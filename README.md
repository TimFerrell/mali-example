# Example gRPC Service using Mali

This example uses [Mali](https://github.com/malijs/mali) for providing a gRPC service. 
It's a very simple todo application that illustrates concepts 
at a high level.
 
It does not provide any safeguards that you'd expect in a real world application.

### Installing
Before the service can start it expects that all dependencies are provided; pull those down first.

`yarn install --pure-lockfile`

### Running
Launch the service!

`npm start`
